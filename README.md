# Zip

Zip is a free .NET Zip library based on the java.util.zip package.  It uses the
freely available zlib library for the compression engine and a contribution
to the zlib library for zip file manipulation.

Note: This is a very old library and I no longer support it.  I'm putting it
up on GitHub for historical and keep safe reasons more than anything.  That said
it has been used in may products and continues to be of some value.
